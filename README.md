# First Prompts

* Headers `<h1>, <h2>... <h6>`
    * Defines titles and subtitles
* Paragraphs `<p>`
    * defines a paragraph, at this point I use these below headers thinking of the structure of an article
* Section `<section>`
    * Think of it like a chapter. It groups related content together.
* figure `<figure>`
    * Connect an image, chart etc. with a caption. Connects the visual with its explanation.
* figcaption `<figcaption>`
    * Optional caption that describes the content.
* Lists `<ul>`, unordered and `<ol>`, ordered (numbered)
     * 
 

# Slightly More Advanced


* Image and image description (for accessibility purposes) `<img src>`and `<alt>`
     * used to add an image and a description of it
     * `<img src="imagelink" alt="Two tabby kittens sleeping together on a couch.">`
* Add a link to your website `<a href>`, make a sentence a hyperlink with following syntax:
     * `<a href="https://anylink.com">cute cats</a> online!</p>`
          * we're turning the words "cute cat" into a clickable link to our chosen adress
* Target `<target>`
     * controls where a link opens when clicking (usually in a new tab)
     * `<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>`
