# First Prompts

* Headers `<h1>, <h2>... <h6>`
    * Defines titles and subtitles
* Paragraphs `<p>`
    * defines a paragraph, at this point I use these bellow headers thinking of the structure of an article
* Section `<section>`
    * Think of it like a chapter. It groups related content together.
* figure `<figure>`
    * Connect an image, chart etc. with a caption. Connects the visual with its explanation.
* figcaption `<figcaption>`
    * Optional caption that describes the content.
 

#Slightly More Advanced

* Add a link to your website `<a href>`, make a sentence a hyperlink with following syntax:
     * `<a href="https://anylink.com">cute cats</a> online!</p>`
          * we're turning the words "cute cat" into a clickable link to our chose adress
