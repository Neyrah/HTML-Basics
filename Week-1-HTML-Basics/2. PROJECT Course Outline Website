      <h1>Week 1 Log – HTML Basics</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This page is my first practice project as I begin learning web
        development. I am following the
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freeCodeCamp</a> course and
        currently using <a href="https://codesandbox.io">CodeSandbox</a> as my
        editor. I also installed VS Code, which I will explore soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help myself learn, I leave comments in the code and write notes about
        what each element does. This helps me remember details and spot mistakes
        faster.

      <h2>First Commands I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        This week I experimented with basic formatting and links. For example,
        let's create a hyperlink to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a> and
        emphasize a word using the <em>em</em> element.
      </p>

      <p>Here are the main commands I practiced:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Setting up a boilerplate (doctype, html, head, body)</li>
        <li>
          Adding headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>)
        </li>
        <li>Writing paragraphs with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Creating links with <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Emphasizing text with <code>&lt;em&gt;</code></li>
        <li>
          Using the <code>target</code> attribute to open links in a new tab
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        At one point I tried to put an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> list inside a
        paragraph, which broke the numbering. Lesson learned: lists should not
        be wrapped in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements.
      </p>

      <h2>Working with Images and SVGs</h2>
      <p>
        I also learned how to include images and SVGs. An SVG can draw shapes
        directly with code. For example, here is a simple star icon:
      </p>
      <svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path
          d="M12 2L15 8L22 9L17 14L18 21L12 18L6 21L7 14L2 9L9 8Z"
          fill="gold"
          stroke="black"
          stroke-width="1"
        />
      </svg>

      <p>
        SVGs are very flexible, but writing them by hand can be tedious. Here is
        a link to <a href="https://flowbite.com/icons/">Flowbite</a>, a free
        collection of SVG icons.
      </p>

      <p>Here is my first use of the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element:</p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/64/58/67/240_F_164586729_XSBUG5huvLbPsOCA13w3DvHlXYsdHWwf.jpg"
          alt="out of context hacker picture"
        />
        <figcaption>
          A caption added with <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>. If I place the
          caption before the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, it appears above the
          image.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

      <h2>Mistakes and Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        • I sometimes forgot to close my elements properly (for example, missing
        a <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>). This caused odd text sizes and
        formatting.<br />
        • Lists should not be placed inside paragraphs.<br />
        • Careful closing of sections and paragraphs is important to keep the
        structure consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with mistakes, this practice helped me understand how HTML works
        and how to debug small issues.
