      <h1>Second Week Commands</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to this second week of HTML wrapup project!<br />
          I started this project by implementing open graph property meta
          elements to the head. These wil give the browser more info on how to
          show the link to this page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a list of the commands and things I learned this week that we
          will be using in addition to those we already know:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open Graph Elements in the head (see code, I added title,
            description and image)
          </li>
          <li><code>&ltinput type&gt</code> to add an interactive element</li>
          <li>
            <code>&ltsmall&gt</code>to add a smaller link under a picture for
            instance
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>&ltmain&gt</code>which we're using to tell the browser that
            this intro is the main part of the page (see code)
          </li>
          <li>Set a path to a document contained on my computer</li>
          <li><code>&ltclass&gt</code>to link to CSS styling</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
    </main>

      <h2>Experimenting with &ltinput type&gt</h2>

      <input type="name" name="username" placeholder="enter name" />
      <p>Seems to be working. Let's try and add some functionality to this.</p>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="username"
        placeholder="change InputType to text?"
      />
      <p>
        After a bit of research I stumbled upon the
        <code>&ltform&gt</code> element.<br />
        It groups elements of submission into a container.<br />
        Also, you can currently only type in the boxes above but nothing
        happens. I would like to try and make this so you can click "enter" and
        it shows something else!<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's make a new box using
        <code>&ltform action="/submit" method="post"&gt</code>:
      </p>
      <form action="/submit" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="enter name" />
      </form>
      <p>
        Now I can hit enter but it sends me to an error page.<br />
        I will leave the rest for later but it was good to experiment with
        interactivity rather than just plain text or links.<br />
        In the future I ought to learn how to authorize only a specific format
        (like an email adress) and how to link this to something else.<br />
        I'm sure there are many more input elements to add things different to a
        box where we can type something!
      </p>

      <h2>Trying out Iframes</h2>
      <p>
        Let's try this with a link to a Web Dev Simplified video on Youtube<br />
        This is too advanced for me for the moment but the playlist if full of
        fun projects to create using the full HTML, CSS and JVS suite.<br />
        I'm saving this for later!
      </p>
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j59qQ7YWLxw?si=fD4ONlpEn2zvAjYi"
        title="fun projects"
        width="600"
        height="400"
      >
      </iframe>
      <p>
        Now let's wrap this Iframe in a figure element so I can use the
        figcaption to add a caption using &ltsmall&gt.<br />
        I also added "allowfullscreen" to enable fullscreen but turns out it
        isn't enough.<br />
        The allow function must include all autorizations provided in the
        youtube boilerplate (accessed via the share -> imbed)<br />
        <br />
        UPDATE: Turns out CodeSandbox and some other environments simply don't
        allow fullscreen but the code should be correct.
      </p>
