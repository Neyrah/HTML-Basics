        <h3>My Birthday!</h3>
        <p>I'm writing this on September 4th and my birthday is on the 7th. Guess who's traveling across the country to celebrate his GF's aunts' birthday instead? ðŸ˜­<br>
The celebration will take place <time datetime="2025-09-07T16:00"> Saturday</time>. Nobody is invited. <!---the <time datetime> is not visible but can be read by the browser for SEO matters--->

        <h3>My GFs' Aunts' Birthday ðŸ˜­ </h3>
        <p>A Three Day Party in Western France. Can't complain, still more fun than celebrating one's own birthday in grim Picardy.<br>
The event will take place <time datetime="2025-09-07T16:00"> Saturday, Sunday and EVEN Monday!</time>.
