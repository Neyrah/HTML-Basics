# ðŸ§‘ Replaced Elements

* Iframes
    * Used to embed another website on your own
    * ```html
      <iframe src="https://www.example.com" title="Example Site"></iframe>```
    * ```html
      <iframe
         src="video-url"
         width="width-value"
         height="height-value"
         allowfullscreen>
      </iframe>```
    * You can also add parameters via or a title:
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      title="YouTube video player"
    * Replace https://youtu.be with https://youtube.com/embed/
    * `<small>`Element to display a smaller text, for instance to link to something else under an iframe or input:
         * ```html
           <small>
              <a href="original link"> View original Link</a>
           </small>```
    * Use srcdoc to embed direct HTML
      
      
* Input Element
    * Used to create interactive controls (name, etc)
    * ```html
      <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name">```
    * can also be used for replaced elements
         * ```html
           <input type="image" alt="Descriptive text goes here" src="example-img-url">```
 

# ðŸ’¡ Other New Commands
   * `<main`> which contains the primary content of the page. Only one per page.
   * Four different ways of telling the browser how to open a link:
        * _self, default value and opens directly
        * _blank, which opens in a new tab
        * _parent and _top (not sure I understand these two yet, will update later)
   * Link
        * `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />`
        * rel specifies relationship between linked resource and HTML document
   * `<Script>` to embed executable code
        *    ```html
             <body>
              <script>
                alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
              </script>```
        * While you can embed all css and jvs onto same page, it is best practice to seperate the files.

# ðŸ›œ More Knowledge

* Absolute and Relative Paths
     * An absolute path starts with a / and will include domain, protocol etc (full URL). Useful because works anywhere but unclean and often long.
          * ://file protocol
     * A relative path can be used for files INSIDE your own project (more flexible)
 
* Difference between /, ./, and ../
     * /, navigates to a subfolder within specidied folder
     * ./, uses directions from the same folder
     * ../ goes back to the parent folder

* Different Link States
     * link, visited, hover, focus, then active (in this order in CSS, hopefully more on that in the coming weeks!)
     * Can be adjusted to taste with CSS
     * This is why a visited link in google turns purple (shows the user that the page can be trusted and that he has already visited it)
 
* id and class
     * id gives a unique identifier for html elements (can be used in a header, a div). Cannot have spaces
     * class can be used several times for grouping and styling (within a div for instance). Can have spaces
