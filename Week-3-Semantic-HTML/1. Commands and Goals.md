# 🧑🏼‍💻 Notes on the Importance of Semantics

* Semantics are of high importance in terms of accesibility, may that be for the browser and SEO or for a web dev team that has to review code and be able to navigate easily.
* A clear structure is key for SEO. Search engines rely on automated programs to scan your page, understand its content, and decide how and when it should appear in search results.
* ⚠️ If your HTML structure is invalid, the browser has to guess what you meant — and its guess may not match what you intended.
 

# 💡 Commands

* The difference between `<div>`, `<section>`:
     * `<div>`might be used for styling while `<section>` holds meaning (assistive technology may use sections to help the user navigate the page)
* The `<article>`element also exists and is slightly different from `<section>`. In an article, the content makes sense on its own

* Some commands like `<font>`, `<center>`, `<big>`or `<small>`are considered deprecated: they're considered obsolete today.
  Thy're part of what is considered presentational HTML.

  * Today, semantic HTML is the recommended pratice. This includes commands such as:
     * `<header>`, `<nav>`(for sections with navigation links,`<section>`or `<figure>`.
     * ```
        <header>
          <nav>
           <a href="#">Home</a>
           <a href="#">About</a>
           <a href="#">Contact</a>
          </nav>
        </header>```


 

# ✅ Goal of The Week

* Design a small website incorporating all these elements.
* Mine here is to design a course outline, using everything I've learned while actively having to recall all the knowledge and building it into a wesbite!
