# 🧑🏼‍💻 Notes on the Importance of Semantics

* Semantics are of high importance in terms of accesibility, may that be for the browser and SEO or for a web dev team that has to review code and be able to navigate easily.
* A clear structure is key for SEO. Search engines rely on automated programs to scan your page, understand its content, and decide how and when it should appear in search results.
* The difference between `<div>`, `<section>`:
     * `<div>`might be used for styling while `<section>` holds meaning (assistive technology may use sections to help the user navigate the page)
     * The `<article>`element also exists and is slightly different from `<section>`. In an article, the content makes sense on its own

# ✅ Goal of The Week

* Design a small website incorporating all these elements.
* Mine here is to design a course outline, using everything I've learned while actively having to recall all the knowledge and building it into a wesbite!
